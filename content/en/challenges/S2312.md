summary = '自然语音交互是人机交互的重要形式之一，但由于高精度的 ASR 模型的运算量巨大，导致 ASR 通常在云端执行，降低了人机交互的体验感。本次竞赛旨在算能 SG2002 处理器上移植高精度的流式 ASR，可选汉语或者英语的 ASR 识别模型，目标是在受限内存 (256 MByte)、实时流式识别 (RTF < 1) 的要求下，实现尽可能低的 WER。参赛者可以参考新一代 Kaldi，Wenet 等开源语音识别项目进行移植'

## Program Description

Natural voice interaction is an important form of human-machine interfacing. However, as high-precision ASR models are computationally intensive, these computation projects are usually run on the cloud, worsening the experience.

This program aims to port high-precision streaming ASR to Sophgo's SG2002 processor. You may choose between Chinese and English models. The goal is to achieve minimum word error rate whilst running on limited RAM (256MBytes) and a rate of RTF<1.

You may reference Kaldi, Wenet, and other open source speech recognition projects for your port.

## Rubrics

1. Offline speech recognition using SG2002's on-board microphone.
2. You are allowed to use RVV0.7, TPU, and other computational resources available on the SG2002.
3. The judging will take into account memory usage, real time factor (RTF), word error rate (WER).
4. The model must run within SG2002's 256MBytes of RAM.
5. Real time factor: Lower is better, the model must support streamed recognition at RTF<1.
6. Word error rate: The model must achieve a WER must be lower than 10% to be considered usable; 5% is ideal.
7. The host will assess both accuracy and performance and assign scores to each submission based on a predetermined weighted scale. The highest scoring submission wins.
